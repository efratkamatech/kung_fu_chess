"""Central configuration: the text-fixture vocabulary and validation codes.

Business logic must never hardcode these tokens. Every layer imports them from
here so the wire/text format lives in exactly one place — critical because VPL
compares program output byte-for-byte, and any format tweak should be a one-line
change here rather than a hunt through the codebase.

Fixture shape (Iteration 1):

    Board:
    wK . . bK
    . . . .
    wR . . bR
    Commands:
    print board

- A ``Board:`` section: rows of space-separated cells; ``.`` is an empty cell;
  a piece is a color prefix (``w``/``b``) + an uppercase type letter (e.g. ``wK``).
- A ``Commands:`` section: one command per line.
